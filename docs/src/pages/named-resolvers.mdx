# Resolving

Morpheus GraphQL provides two way of the type resolving.

1. **Values as resolvers**: In this approach, you just specify values
   for the type definitions, where the resolvers are regular functions.
2. **Named resolvers**: In this approach, we use the type class `ResolveNamed` to define the
   resolver for each type. More information on this approach can be
   found in the next section.

## Named Resolvers

###### Note: this feature will be introduced in version **0.18.0**

As mentioned earlier, in this approach we use `ResolveNamed`
to define the resolver function for each type. In this resolver definition,
each type also defines its dependency (identifier), which is used by the
compiler to provide a corresponding output resolution for certain input values.
That is, if we want to resolve a type as a field of another type, we must
specify a type dependency value for that particular type
instead of the type value. For a better illustration,
let's look at the following example:

Let's say we want to create a GraphQL app for
a blogging website where we can either retrieve
all posts or retrieve them by ID. Scheme definition for this
application would be as follows.

_App/Posts.hs_

```haskell
newtype Post m = Post
  { title :: m Text
  }
  deriving
    ( Generic,
      GQLType
    )

data Query m = Query
  { posts :: m [Post m],
    post :: Arg "id" ID -> m (Maybe (Post m))
  }
  deriving
    ( Generic,
      GQLType
    )
```

Now that we have type definitions, we can define their resolvers,
starting with type post. The following instance specifies that for each unique `ID`
we can resolve the corresponding `Post`, where the post `title` is requested by the post `ID`.

```haskell
instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Post (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Post (NamedResolverT m)) = ID
  resolveNamed uid =
    pure
      Post
        { title = resolve (getPostTitleById uid)
        }
```

Let's go to the next stage and define query resolver.

```haskell
instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Query (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Query (NamedResolverT m)) = ()
  resolveNamed () =
    pure
      Query
        { posts = resolve getPostIds,
          post = \(Arg arg) -> resolve (pure (Just arg))
        }
```

```haskell
postsApp :: App () IO
postsApp =
  deriveApp
    (NamedResolvers :: NamedResolvers IO () Query Undefined Undefined)
```

_Authors.hs_

```haskell
data Author m = Author
  { name :: m Text,
    posts :: m [Post m]
  } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Author (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Author (NamedResolverT m)) = ID
  resolveNamed uid =
    pure
      Author
        { name = resolve (getAuthorName uid),
          posts = resolve (getAuthorPosts uid)
        }

-- is alternative to extend type
newtype Post m = Post
  { author :: m (Author m)
  } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Post (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Post (NamedResolverT m)) = ID
  resolveNamed uid =
    pure
      Post
        { author = resolve (pure uid)
        }

-- QUERY
data Query m = Query
  { authors :: m [Author m],
    authorById :: Arg "id" ID -> m (Maybe (Author m))
  }
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Query (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Query (NamedResolverT m)) = ()
  resolveNamed () =
    pure
      Query
        { authors = resolve getAuthorIds,
          authorById = \(Arg uid) -> resolve (pure (Just uid))
        }

authorsApp :: App () IO
authorsApp =
  deriveApp
    (NamedResolvers :: NamedResolvers IO () Query Undefined Undefined)
```

_App.hs_

```haskell
app :: App () IO
app = authorsApp <> postsApp
```

since the both `Post` type definitions have same dependency `ID`,
the interpreter safelly merge this two apps where type
`Post` will be extended with new field `author`.
