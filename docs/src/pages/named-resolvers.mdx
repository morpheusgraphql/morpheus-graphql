# Resolving

Morpheus GraphQL provides two way of type resolving.

1. **Values as resolvers**: In this approach, you specify values
   for the type definitions, where the resolvers are regular functions.
2. **Named resolvers**: In this approach, we use the type class `ResolveNamed` to define the
   resolver for each type. More information on this approach can be
   found in the next section.

<Section id="named-resolvers" level={1}>
  Named Resolvers
</Section>

As mentioned earlier, in this approach we use `ResolveNamed`
to define the resolver function for each type. In this resolver definition,
each type also defines its dependency (identifier), which is used by the
compiler to provide a corresponding output resolution for certain input values.
That is, if we want to resolve a type as a field of another type, we must
specify a type dependency value for that particular type
instead of the type value. For a better illustration,
let's look at the following example:

<Section id="app-posts" level={2}>
  App/Posts.hs
</Section>

Let's say we want to create a GraphQL app for
a blogging website where we can either retrieve
all posts or retrieve them by ID. Scheme definition for this
application would be as follows.

```haskell
newtype Post m = Post
  { title :: m Text
  }
  deriving
    ( Generic,
      GQLType
    )

data Query m = Query
  { posts :: m [Post m],
    post :: Arg "id" ID -> m (Maybe (Post m))
  }
  deriving
    ( Generic,
      GQLType
    )
```

Now that we have type definitions, we can define their resolvers,
starting with type `Post`. The following instance specifies that for each unique `ID`
we can resolve the corresponding `Post`, where the post `title` is retrieved by the post `ID`.

```haskell
instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Post (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Post (NamedResolverT m)) = ID
  resolveNamed uid =
    pure
      Post
        { title = resolve (getPostTitleById uid)
        }
```

Let's go to the next step and define a query resolver. Since the query does not
require an ID, we define its dependency with the unit type.

To resolve the `post` and `posts` fields, we only get post ids and
pass them to the resolve function, which then resolves the
corresponding `Post` values by calling the `ResolveNamed`
instance of the type `Post` with those ids.

```haskell
instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Query (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Query (NamedResolverT m)) = ()
  resolveNamed () =
    pure
      Query
        { posts = resolve getPostIds,
          post = \(Arg arg) -> resolve (pure (Just arg))
        }
```

In the last step, we can derive the GraphQL application using
the data type `NamedResolvers` by using a single constructor
`NamedResolvers` without any fields.

```haskell
postsApp :: App () IO
postsApp =
  deriveApp
    (NamedResolvers :: NamedResolvers IO () Query Undefined Undefined)
```

In the background, the function `deriveApp` traverses the data types and calls their
own instances of `NamedResolver` for each object and union type. In this way,
a `ResolverMaps` (with type `Map TypeName (DependencyValue -> ResolveValue)`) is derived that can
be used in GraphQL query execution.

As you can see, the `ResolverMaps` derived in this way can be
merged if the types with the same name have the same GraphQL
kind and the same dependency.
Therefore, types in applications derived with `NamedResolvers` can be safely extended,
which we will see in the next section.

<Section id="app-authors" level={2}>
  App/Authors.hs
</Section>

Let's say there is another team that wants to use the `Posts` application as well,
but also needs to provide `Authors` information. The new application should
allow querying of all existing `Authors` and extend the post type with the field `author`.

One way to address these new requirements would be to rewrite our old application,
but that will impact (or even break) the existing application. Here, named resolvers can
be of additional help to us, as `Apps` derived with named resolvers can be merged.
We can define our `Authors` app separately and then merge it with the existing one.

In the following code snippets we define the Author and Query types.

```haskell
data Author m = Author
  { name :: m Text,
    posts :: m [Post m]
  } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data Query m = Query
  { authors :: m [Author m]
  }
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)
```

As you can see, we can query `authors`, with each `Author` having their fields `name` and `posts`.
in the same manner as before, we can also provide their resolver implementation.

```haskell
instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Author (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Author (NamedResolverT m)) = ID
  resolveNamed uid =
    pure
      Author
        { name = resolve (getAuthorName uid),
          posts = resolve (getAuthorPosts uid)
        }

instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Query (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Query (NamedResolverT m)) = ()
  resolveNamed () = pure Query { authors = resolve getAuthorIds }
```

At this stage, we have already implemented Authors and Query and now we can also
start thinking about the Post Type.

First note, that the post type used in this app does not need to
be imported from the `App/Posts.hs`. We can simply define our type `Post` with the new
field `author` and all other fields associated with the post type will be automatically
completed by the app `App/Posts.hs`, after the merging.

```haskell
-- is alternative to extend type
newtype Post m = Post
  { author :: m (Author m)
  } deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )
```

Now we can start implementing the resolver for it.
It is of critical importance here, that the dependency of this type 
is the same as the dependency of `Post` in `App/Posts.hs`. If the 
argument of the function does not match, one of the implementations
will be unable to decode the argument during resolution and it will fail.

```haskell
instance Monad m => ResolveNamed m (Post (NamedResolverT m)) where
  type Dep (Post (NamedResolverT m)) = ID
  resolveNamed uid =
    pure
      Post
        { author = resolve (pure uid)
        }
```

Since all resolvers are implemented, we can also derive the application.
Note that this application can be used as a standalone application, however
the standalone version can only display the information provided by the Authors,
i.e. the Post type will only have one field authors,
and in the query we can only access authors.

```haskell
authorsApp :: App () IO
authorsApp =
  deriveApp
    (NamedResolvers :: NamedResolvers IO () Query Undefined Undefined)
```

However, if we want to access information from both apps,
the next section will show us how to merge them.

<Section id="merged-app" level={2}>
  App.hs
</Section>

The data type `App` has a `Semigroup` instance that allows to
join multiple apps together.

```haskell
app :: App () IO
app = authorsApp <> postsApp
```

Since both the `Post` type definitions have the same dependency `ID`,
the interpreter safely merge these two apps where type
`Post` will be extended with new field `author`.
