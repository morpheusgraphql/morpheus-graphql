Moprheus GraphQL also supports generating code from GraphQL
documents. To do this, you should first install
the `morpheus-graphql-code-gen` package. to get a correct result,
make sure that the package versions match.

the package provides cli `morpheus` with commands `build` and `check` .
The `build` command generates files from the GQL source files
contained in the `code-gen.yaml` configuration for the specified project root.
However, the `check` command only checks if the generated files match the existing GQL documents,
which is quite handy to check if the files are outdated.

Let's take a look at the following project. where we have different
posts and users and want to develop an application for client and server.

```
├── package.yaml
├── code-gen.yaml
└── src
    ├── Main.hs
    ├── Scalars.hs
    ├── Server
    |   └── Blog.gql
    └── Client
        ├── Blog.gql
        └── Queries
            ├── GetPosts.gql
            └── GetUsers.gql
```

where files are defined as follows.

**src/Scalars.hs**

```hs
newtype Markdown = Markdown Text
  deriving
    ( Show,
      Generic,
      Eq
    )

instance GQLType Markdown where
  type KIND Markdown = SCALAR

instance DecodeScalar Markdown where
  decodeScalar (String x) = pure (Markdown x)
  decodeScalar _ = fail "not suppoorted"

instance EncodeScalar Markdown where
  encodeScalar (Markdown x) = String x

instance FromJSON Markdown where
  parseJSON = scalarFromJSON

instance ToJSON Markdown where
  toJSON = scalarToJSON
```

**src/Server/Blog.gql** and **src/Client/Blog.gql**

```graphql
scalar Markdown

type Post {
  title: String!
  body: Markdown
}

type User {
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Query {
  users: [User!]!
  posts: [Post!]!
}
```

**src/Client/Queries/GetPosts.gql**

```graphql
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    title
    body
  }
}
```

**src/Client/Queries/GetUsers.gql**

```graphql
query GetUsers {
  users {
    name
    posts {
      title
      body
    }
  }
}
```

to generate files from it, we should now configure `code-gen.yaml`.

```yaml
server:
  - name: Server API # Name of the service
    source: ./src # root folder for haskell source files
    includes:
      - Server/**/*.gql # list of gql sources
    options:
      globals:
        - Scalars # imports Markdown type declatation from Scalars.hs
client:
  - name: Client API # Name of the service
    source: ./src # root folder for haskell source files
    schema: Client/Blog.gql
    includes:
      - Client/Queries/**/*.gql # list of gql sources
    options:
      globals:
        - Scalars # imports Markdown type declatation from Scalars.hs
```

now we are ready to generate types.

```ssh
morpheus build ./
```

command will lookup `code-gen.yaml` and generate following files.

```
|── src
    ├── Server
    |   └── Blog.hs
    └── Client
        ├── Blog.hs
        └── Queries
            ├── GetPosts.hs
            └── GetUsers.hs
```
