<Section id="type-system">Type System</Section>

Morpheus GraphQL covers all GraphQL data types with an equivalent
Haskell representation. A prerequisite for these representation types is that
they must be derived by `Generic` and provide corresponding `GQLType` instances.

<Section id="objects" level={2}>
  Object types
</Section>

Object types are represented in Morpheus with Haskell records,
where the parameter `m` passes the resolution monad
to the field resolution functions. The following code snippet, for example,
defines the type Deity with a nullable field `power` and a non-nullable field `name`.

```haskell
data Deity m = Deity
  { name :: m Text         -- Non-Nullable Field
  , power :: m Maybe Text   -- Nullable Field
  } deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )
```

<Section id="arguments" level={3}>
  Arguments
</Section>

GraphQL arguments can be represented with two ways:

#### Haskell records

we can use Haskell records to declare GraphQL arguments,
where each field of a record represents a particular
argument, and can be accessed by name.

```haskell
data Query m = Query
  { deity :: DeityArgs -> m Deity
  } deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )

data DeityArgs = DeityArgs
  { name      :: Text        -- Required Argument
  , mythology :: Maybe Text  -- Optional Argument
  } deriving
     ( Generic,
       GQLType
     )
```

This approach is quite convenient for representing multiple arguments,
but cumbersome if we only need one argument for each field.
That is why we also introduce "Tagged Arguments".

#### Tagged function arguments

Tagged arguments leverage type-level literals and enable GraphQL
arguments to be represented as a chain of named function arguments.
e.g. the following type defines GraphQL field `deity` with the
optional argument `name` of type `String`.

```haskell
data Query m = Query
  { deity :: Arg "name" (Maybe Text) -> m Deity
  } deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )
```

<Section id="query" level={3}>
  Query
</Section>

the GraphQL query type is represented in Morpheus GraphQL as a regular object type named `Query`.

```haskell
data Query m = Query
  { deity ::  m Deity
  } deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )
```

<Section id="mutations" level={3}>
  Mutations
</Section>

In addition to queries, Morpheus also supports mutations. They behave just like regular queries and are defined similarly:

```haskell
newtype Mutation m = Mutation
  { createDeity :: MutArgs -> m Deity
  } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

rootResolver :: RootResolver IO  () Query Mutation Undefined
rootResolver =
  RootResolver
    { queryResolver = Query {...}
    , mutationResolver = Mutation { createDeity }
    , subscriptionResolver = Undefined
    }
    where
      -- Mutation Without Event Triggering
      createDeity :: MutArgs -> ResolverM () IO Deity
      createDeity_args = lift setDBAddress

gqlApi :: ByteString -> IO ByteString
gqlApi = interpreter rootResolver
```

<Section id="subscription" level={3}>
  Subscriptions
</Section>

In morpheus subscription and mutation communicate with Events,
`Event` consists with user defined `Channel` and `Content`.

Every subscription has its own Channel by which it will be triggered

```haskell
data Channel
  = ChannelA
  | ChannelB

data Content
  = ContentA Int
  | ContentB Text

type MyEvent = Event Channel Content

newtype Query m = Query
  { deity :: m Deity
  } deriving (Generic)

newtype Mutation m = Mutation
  { createDeity :: m Deity
  } deriving (Generic)

newtype Subscription (m ::  * -> * ) = Subscription
  { newDeity :: m  Deity
  } deriving (Generic)

newtype Subscription (m :: * -> *) = Subscription
{ newDeity :: SubscriptionField (m Deity),
}
deriving (Generic)


type APIEvent = Event Channel Content

rootResolver :: RootResolver IO APIEvent Query Mutation Subscription
rootResolver = RootResolver
  { queryResolver        = Query { deity = fetchDeity }
  , mutationResolver     = Mutation { createDeity }
  , subscriptionResolver = Subscription { newDeity }
  }
 where
  -- Mutation Without Event Triggering
  createDeity :: ResolverM EVENT IO Address
  createDeity = do
      requireAuthorized
      publish [Event { channels = [ChannelA], content = ContentA 1 }]
      lift dbCreateDeity
  newDeity :: SubscriptionField (ResolverS EVENT IO Deity)
  newDeity = subscribe ChannelA $ do
    -- executed only once
    -- immediate response on failures
    requireAuthorized
    pure $ \(Event _ content) -> do
        -- executes on every event
        lift (getDBAddress content)
```

<Section id="scalars" level={2}>
  Scalar types
</Section>

any Haskell data type can be represented as a GraphQL scalar type.
In order to do this, the type must be associated as
`SCALAR` and implemented with `DecodeScalar` and `EncodeScalar` instances.

```haskell
data Odd = Odd Int  deriving (Generic)

instance DecodeScalar Euro where
  decodeScalar (Int x) = pure $ Odd (... )
  decodeScalar _ = Left "invalid Value!"

instance EncodeScalar Euro where
  encodeScalar (Odd value) = Int value

instance GQLType Odd where
  type KIND Odd = SCALAR
```

<Section id="enums" level={2}>
  Enumeration types
</Section>

Data types where all constructors are empty are derived as GraphQL enums.

```haskell
data City
  = Athens
  | Sparta
  | Corinth
  | Delphi
  | Argos
  deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )
```

<Section id="wrappers" level={2}>
  Lists and Non-Null
</Section>

GraphQL Lists are represented with Haskell Lists.
However, since in Haskell each type is intrinsically not nullable,
nullable GraphQL fields are represented with `Maybe` Haskell data type and non-nullable
GraphQL fields with regular Haskell datatypes.

<Section id="interfaces" level={2}>
  Interfaces
</Section>

GraphQL interfaces is represented in Morpheus with `TypeGuard`.
in the following data type definition every use of `PersonInterface`
will be represented as GraphQL interface `Person` and allow server to
resolve different types from union `PersonImplements`.

All types of the union `PersonImplements` must be objects
and contain fields of type `Person`, otherwise the derivation fails.

```haskell
  -- interface Person
data Person m = Person { name ::  m Text }
  deriving
    (
      Generic,
      GQLType
    )

data PersonImplements m
  = PersonImplementsUser (User m)
  | PersonImplementsDeity (Deity m)
  deriving
    (
      Generic,
      GQLType
    )

-- typeGuard guards all variabts of union with person fields
type PersonInterface m = TypeGuard Person (PersonImplements m)
```

<Section id="unions" level={2}>
  Unions
</Section>

To use union type, all you have to do is derive the `GQLType` class. Using GraphQL [_fragments_](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments), the arguments of each data constructor can be accessed from the GraphQL client.

```haskell
data Character
  = CharacterDeity Deity -- will be unwrapped, since Character + Deity = CharacterDeity
  | SomeDeity Deity -- will be wrapped since Character + Deity != SomeDeity
  | Creature { creatureName :: Text, creatureAge :: Int }
  | Demigod Text Text
  | Zeus
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)
```

where `Deity` is an object.

As we see, there are different kinds of unions. `Morpheus` handles them all.

This type will be represented as

```graphql
union Character = Deity | SomeDeity | Creature | SomeMulti | Zeus

type SomeDeity {
  _0: Deity!
}

type Creature {
  creatureName: String!
  creatureAge: Int!
}

type Demigod {
  _0: Int!
  _1: String!
}

type Zeus {
  _: Unit!
}
```

By default, union members will be generated with wrapper objects.
There is one exception to this: if a constructor of a type is the type name concatenated with the name of the contained type, it will be referenced directly.
That is, given:

```haskell
data Song = { songName :: Text, songDuration :: Float } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data Skit = { skitName :: Text, skitDuration :: Float } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data WrappedNode
  = WrappedSong Song
  | WrappedSkit Skit
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data NonWrapped
  = NonWrappedSong Song
  | NonWrappedSkit Skit
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

```

You will get the following schema:

```graphql
# has wrapper types
union WrappedNode = WrappedSong | WrappedSkit

# is a direct union
union NonWrapped = Song | Skit

type WrappedSong {
  _0: Song!
}

type WrappedSKit {
  _0: Skit!
}

type Song {
  songDuration: Float!
  songName: String!
}

type Skit {
  skitDuration: Float!
  skitName: String!
}
```

- for all other unions will be generated new object type. for types without record syntax, fields will be automatically indexed.

- empty constructors will get field `_`associaced with type `Unit`.

<Section id="inputs" level={2}>
  Input types
</Section>

Like object types, input types are represented by Haskell records.
However, they are not permitted to have monad parameters, as they represent serialisable values.

```haskell
data Deity = Deity
  { name :: Text         -- Non-Nullable Field
  , power :: Maybe Text   -- Nullable Field
  } deriving
    ( Generic
    , GQLType
    )
```
