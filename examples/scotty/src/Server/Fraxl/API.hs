-- This file contains an example of how to use the `fraxl` library to address
-- the N+1 queries problem, a common problem with implementing GraphQL APIs.
--
-- We'll explain this problem more as we go, but first, let's define our GraphQL
-- API - here we have a database of bands, musicians, and instruments.  For the
-- purposes of this example, each band member is a member of a single band and
-- plays a single instrument.  The user can query for a list of all instruments
-- in the database.

newtype Query m = Query
  { instruments :: m [Instrument m]
  }
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data Instrument m = Instrument
  { name :: Text,
    players :: m [BandMember m]
  }
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data BandMember m = BandMember
  { name :: Text,
    band :: m (Band m)
  }
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

data Band m = Band
  { name :: Text,
    members :: m [BandMember m]
  }
  deriving (Generic, GQLType)

-- Now, imagine we have a database structure with an `instrument` table, a
-- `band_memmber` table, and a `band` table.
--
-- To query all instruments, we would need to do a SELECT on the `instrument`
-- table.  If the graphql client asks for the `players` field of our
-- `Instrument` graphql type, we'll also have to get the band members associated
-- with each instrument.
--
-- One way to implement this would be to make a separate SELECT on the
-- `band_member` table for each instrument ID we receive from our initial SELECT
-- on the `instrument` table.  However, this will have bad performance with a
-- large number of instruments, since we'll have to send many queries to the
-- database.  This is a prototypical example of the N+1 queries problem.  While
-- there are many ways to achieve good performance, such as pre-fetching, the
-- `fraxl` library provides a particularly elegant solution to this issue.
--
-- To use `fraxl`, first we have to define a `Source` GADT that represents all
-- the different (unbatched) queries we can make to the database.

data Source a where
  GetInstruments :: Source [DB.Instrument]
  GetBandMemberByInstrumentID :: Int -> Source [DB.Member]
  GetBandMemberByBandID :: Int -> Source [DB.Member]
  GetBandByID :: Int -> Source DB.Band

-- Now, we define a type that represents a "batched" request, containing
-- potentially multiple different queries.

data BatchedReq = BatchedReq
  { memberInstrumentIDs :: Set Int,
    memberBandIDs :: Set Int,
    bandIDs :: Set Int
  }

-- Then, we define how to combine many `Source a` into a single `BatchedReq`.
-- Here `ASeq` is a heterogenous list type over `Source`.

batchSource :: ASeq Source a -> BatchedReq
batchSource = flip execState (BatchedReq mempty mempty mempty) . traverseASeq batch
  where
    batch :: Source a -> State BatchedReq (Source a)
    batch x@(GetBandMemberByInstrumentID y) = modify (\b -> b {memberInstrumentIDs = singleton y <> memberInstrumentIDs b}) >> pure x
    batch x@(GetBandMemberByBandID y) = modify (\b -> b {memberBandIDs = singleton y <> memberBandIDs b}) >> pure x
    batch x@(GetBandByID y) = modify (\b -> b {bandIDs = singleton y <> bandIDs b}) >> pure x
    batch x = pure x

-- Next, we define a result of the batched request.

data BatchedRes = BatchedRes
  { memberByInstrumentIDs :: Map Int [DB.Member],
    memberByBandIDs :: Map Int [DB.Member],
    bands :: Map Int DB.Band
  }

-- And, how to run the batched request to get a batched result - here `DB.Query`
-- is a monad that tracks the effect of accessing the database.

runBatch :: BatchedReq -> DB.Query BatchedRes
runBatch BatchedReq {memberInstrumentIDs, memberBandIDs, bandIDs} =
  BatchedRes
    <$> DB.getBandMembersByInstrumentID memberInstrumentIDs
    <*> DB.getBandMembersByBandID memberBandIDs
    <*> DB.getBandsByID bandIDs

-- This, `doFetch` helper actually provides the value for each `Source a`, while
-- reading from a `BatchedRes` result.

doFetch :: Source a -> Reader BatchedRes (DB.Query a)
doFetch GetInstruments = pure DB.getInstruments
doFetch (GetBandMemberByInstrumentID i) =
  asks (pure . fromJust . Data.Map.lookup i . memberByInstrumentIDs)
doFetch (GetBandMemberByBandID i) =
  asks (pure . fromJust . Data.Map.lookup i . memberByBandIDs)
doFetch (GetBandByID i) =
  asks (pure . fromJust . Data.Map.lookup i . bands)

-- We bundle these helpers together into a `fraxl` `Fetch`, which
-- interprets an `ASeq` of `Source a`s under the `DB.Query` monad.  This is
-- where the power of fraxl lies - while handling a GraphQL request, this
-- `fetch` will be invoked multiple times, each time with a collection of
-- `Source a` requests that do not depend on eachother. This allows us to use
-- `batchSource` to combine a large number of `Source`s into a single database query.
--
-- For more on how this works, see the `fraxl` documentation or documentation on
-- `Haxl`, the library that inspired fraxl.

fetchSource :: Fetch Source DB.Query a
fetchSource as = runReader (traverseASeq doFetch as) <$> runBatch (batchSource as)

-- Now, we write our QraphQL resolvers, using `fraxl`'s `dataFetch` with one of
-- our `Source` constructors whenever we need to access the DB.
